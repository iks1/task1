Open source is something that exites me a lot. After coming to college i wanted to learn as much as i could apar from from academics. And open source is making possible for me . Open source communities like CNCF,Gsoc, MLH, lfx, give the opportunity to learn from developers all around the world. It is so much good to see when your work get appreciated by students from other countries as well. Open source is something from where we can learn by soing mistakes.
